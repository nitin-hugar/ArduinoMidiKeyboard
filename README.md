# ArduinoMidiKeyboard
A MIDI controller made with arduino

The project uses a microcontroller to convert all analog and digital incoming signals to MIDI signals and then it is linked to either recording software or performance keyboards to enable varieties of samples, synths and sounds. The same signals are used as control signals to edit functions, frequencies, mod wheels and the like.
